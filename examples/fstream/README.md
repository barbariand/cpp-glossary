# fstream
This example project will have a brief overview of how to use the basic functions of the `<fstream>` library. The project will to the following.

1. Create a unique filename
1. Check if the file exist
1. Write to the file
1. Read from the file
1. Delete the file

Super simple program that will be using `<iostream>` and `<fstream>`.

The deletion is made using the built in `std::delete` function that uses a C-style string.
We will thereby convert from the C++-style string to the C-style string.
